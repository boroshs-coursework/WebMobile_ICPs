# Web_ICP1: Tools (GitHub and WebStorm)

Summary - In this ICP, we installed WebStorm and learned how to use Git and GitHub. Using Git and GitHub, we learned how to make a new repository; clone a remote repository to a local machine; add, commit, and push changes from a local repo to a remote repo; pull from a remote repo to a local repo; fork a repo; handle pull requests; make an issue; and deal with branches. We also learned how to organize our remote repo folders, Wikis, and videos for submission.
